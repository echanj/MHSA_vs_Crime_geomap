Description:

These are codes and data for an ongoing data science project which exploits the use of RESTful API 
and folium for Mapping. I got to play around with some SQL. 
I also did some AB H0-testing with p-values based on t-statistic. 

The descriptions of how to use are in mini_project_main_2023.ipynb so start there.

The study aims to gain insight into the influence of mental health care shortages on crime rates. 
It uses two sources of data, the US Health Resources & Services Administration and the FBI Crime Data Explorer.

Data on US health provider shortage areas, specifically mental health is from the USÂ  Health Resources & Services Administration. The first dataset is actually avaliable as a table we will refer to as the Mental Health Shortage Area (MHSA) table, specifically with data on areas in the USA with mental Heath care shortages and was available from the Google Cloud Marketplace made accessible via BigQuery. 

It is organized around the data reporting systems the FBI UCR program uses and their related entities.
Agencies submit data to the CDE using either the Summary Reporting System (SRS) or the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS).
